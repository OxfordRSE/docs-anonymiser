## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- Bash


## To run

Create docker image

`docker build --tag docs-anonymiser .`

For PDFs that have been digitally generated, place all PDFs in a folder and run

`./docs-anonymiser.sh -d folder_path`

The character recognition will not perform well if the pages are skewed (e.g. from 
scanned PDFs) so they need to be corrected. Performing skewness correction on pages that 
do not require it, will not change them but it will increase running time (~1 min per 
page). To anonymise PDFs with skewness correction run

`./docs-anonymiser.sh -d folder_path -s`
